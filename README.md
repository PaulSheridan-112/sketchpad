My First JavaScript/JQuery Project

Made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery

Project requirements were to build a simple sketchpad type app using grids.

The grids had to be created using javascript/Jquery

HTML and CSS were used to create a simple yet elegant design.

Buttons were given functions in JQuery

Added a prompt which takes a number as an input for width of grid
